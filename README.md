# Cloud Portfolio – Practice Labs (AWS & Azure)

Welcome to my Cloud Portfolio Repository, a curated collection of hands‑on labs demonstrating my practical experience across AWS and Azure. These labs reflect my continuous learning journey in cloud engineering, covering real‑world scenarios, architecture patterns, automation, and operational excellence. Each lab is designed to be modular, reproducible, and aligned with industry best practices.
