## Cloud Computing Specialist | Secure, Scalable Architectures

## About Me

I’m an experienced software developer transitioning into cloud computing, specializing in Azure and AWS.  
With 9+ years of background in enterprise applications (C#.NET, SQL Server), I now focus on designing secure, scalable architectures across multi‑region environments.  
My hands‑on projects highlight expertise in automation, networking, and modern cloud services.
